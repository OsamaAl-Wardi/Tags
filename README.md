Tags: a website that takes your video and annotate it. You just need to give a video link and our algorithm will deliver you a set of words for each scene with given interval (frame start, frame end).

Definition of annotate: provide words that describe an object, this case, a frame, a scene, or the video.

Features:
- annotate scenes: frames that share similarities and settings i.e. environment or context.
- annotate video: (ultimate goal)

My role: I implemented the python backbone of the algorithm which discretises the video into frames and uses the google cloud vision API to detect objects in the scene.
